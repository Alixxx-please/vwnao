## ❔ **About**

**"Vanilla was never an option" (VWNAO)** is meant to be a complete but simple modpack, whether for your two weeks Minecraft addiction or just your everyday usage. It consists of dozens of small QoL & optimization mods combined all together to optimise your gameplay and make it more enjoyable, comfortable to use. I initially made this modpack for some friends but as they seemed to like it, I've decided to release it here so that everyone can enjoy it!

## ❓**FAQ**
> **Q:** Is there a big performance gap compared to [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized)?
>
> **A:** Short answer, no. You may have a different experience depending on your hardware, but overall it should be unnoticeable.

<br>

> **Q:** What modloader / version should I use?
>
> **A:** This modpack is configured to be used with both [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/en) and [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) modding toolchains. As for the versions, the latest release (not including snapshots and pre-releases) will always be the one supported.

<br>

> **Q:** How would I play with my friends using [Essential](https://modrinth.com/mod/essential)?
>
> **A:** First, create a new world as you would do in singleplayer and leave it when it's done loading. Then, add your friend through the `Social` tab on the right side of the main menu. After that, simply join your newly created world again and simply invite your friend through the pause menu!
